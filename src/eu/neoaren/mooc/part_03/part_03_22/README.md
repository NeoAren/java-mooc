# Part 03 - 22 - Print in stars

Complete the method `public static void printArrayInStars(int[] array)` in the class named 'Printer' to make it print a row of stars for each number in the array. The amount of stars on each row is defined by the corresponding number in the array.

You can try out the printing with this example:

```java
int[] array = {5, 1, 3, 4, 2};
printArrayInStars(array);
```

```
*****
*
***
****
**
```

The 0th element of the array is 5, so the first line has 5 stars. The next one has 1 etc.
