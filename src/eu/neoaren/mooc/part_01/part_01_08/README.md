# Part 01 - 08 - Greeting

Write a program that prompts the user for their name with the message "What's your name?". When the user has written their name, the program has to print "Hi " followed by the user's name.

The exercise template already includes the code that creates the `Scanner` tool.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Greeting {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Write your program here
    }
}
```

Example output when user gives the name Ada.

```
What's your name?
Ada
Hi Ada
```

Example output when user gives the name Lily.

```
What's your name?
Lily
Hi Lily
```
