# Part 01 - 04 - Dinosaur

The exercise comes ready with the following template:

```java
public class Dinosaur {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your program here
    }
}
```

Edit the program so that it will print the following text. Use the `sout`-shorthand for writing the print commands.

```
Once upon a time
there was
a dinosaur
```
