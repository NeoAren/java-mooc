# Part 01 - 35 - Checking the age

Write a program that prompts the user to input their age and checks whether it is possible (at least 0 and at most 120). Only use a single if-command in your program.

```
How old are you? 10
OK
```

```
How old are you? 55
OK
```

```
How old are you? -3
Impossible!
```

```
How old are you? 150
Impossible!
```
