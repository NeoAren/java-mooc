# Part 01 - 09 - Conversation

The exercise template already includes the code that creates the Scanner tool.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Conversation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        //Write your program here
    }
}
```

Write a program that works as follows:

```
Greetings! How are you doing?
Good thank you!
Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!
Well, there's really nothing to tell.
Thanks for sharing!
```

```
Greetings! How are you doing?
Nice and dandy like cotton candy!
Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!
Just went shopping.
Thanks for sharing!
```
