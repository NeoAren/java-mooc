# Part 04 - 07 - Product

Create a class `Product` that represents a store product. The product should have a price (double), a quantity (int) and a name (String).

The class should have:
- The constructor `public Product (String initialName, double initialPrice, int initialQuantity)`
- A method public void printProduct() that prints product information in the following format

```
Banana, price 1.1, 13 pcs
```

The output above is based on the product being assigned the name `banana`, with a price of `1.1`, and a quantity of `13`.
