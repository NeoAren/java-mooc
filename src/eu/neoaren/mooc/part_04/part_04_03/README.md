# Part 04 - 03 - Dog attributes

In this exercise, you'll practice creating a class.

Name the class `Dog` in this exercise. You have now created a class called `Dog`. Add the variables `private String name`, `private String breed` and `private int age` to the class. As a class diagram, the class looks like this:

|Dog|
|---|
|name: String|
|breed: String|
|age: int|

The class doesn't do much yet. However, practicing this step is valuable for what is to come.
