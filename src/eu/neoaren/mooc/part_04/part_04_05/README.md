# Part 04 - 05 - Whistle

Create a class named `Whistle`. Add the variable `private String sound` to the class. After that, create the constructor `public Whistle(String whistleSound)`, which is used to create a new whistle that's given a sound.

```java
Whistle duckWhistle = new Whistle("Kvaak");
Whistle roosterWhistle = new Whistle("Peef");

duckWhistle.sound();
roosterWhistle.sound();
duckWhistle.sound();
```

```
