# Part 02 - 33 - Star sign

### Part 1: Printing stars

Define a method called printStars that prints the given number of stars, and a line break.

Write the method in the following template:

```java
public static void printStars(int number) {
    // you can print one star with the command
    // System.out.print("*");
    // call the print command n times
    // in the end print a line break with the comand
    // System.out.println("");
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    printStars(5);
    printStars(3);
    printStars(9);
}
```

The output of the program:

```
*****
***
*********
```

### Part 2: Printing a square

Define a method called `printSquare(int size)` that prints a suitable square with the help of the `printStars` method. So the method call `printSquare(4)` results in the following output:

```
****
****
****
****
```

**NB!** Producing the correct output is not enough; the rows of the square must be produced by calling the `printStars` method inside the `printSquare` method.

When creating the program, you can use the code in the main to test that the methods behave as required.

### Part 3: Printing a rectangle

Write a method called `printRectangle(int width, int height)` that prints the correct rectangle by using the `printStars` method. So the method call `printRectangle(17, 3)` should produce the following output:

```
*****************
*****************
*****************
```

### Part 4: Printing a triangle

Create a method called `printTriangle(int size)` that prints a triangle by using the `printStars` method. So the call `printTriangle(4)` should print the following

```
*
**
***
****
```
