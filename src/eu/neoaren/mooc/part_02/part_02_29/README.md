# Part 02 - 29 - Summation

Expand the method `sum` in the exercise template so that it calculates and returns the sum of the numbers that are given as the parameters.

Create the method using the following structure:

```java
public static int sum(int number1, int number2, int number3, int number4) {
    // write your code here
    // remember to include return (at the end)!
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int answer = sum(4, 3, 6, 1);
    System.out.println("Sum: " + answer);
}
```

The output of the program:

```
Sum: 14
```

*NB**! When an exercise describes a method that should return something, this means that the type of the return value must be declared in the method definition, and that the method contains a `return` command that returns the wanted data. The method itself will print nothing (i.e. will not use the command `System.out.println`) - that task is left to the method caller, which in this case is the main program.
