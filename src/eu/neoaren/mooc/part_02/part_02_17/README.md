# Part 02 - 17 - Sum of a sequence

Implement a program, which calculates the sum 1+2+3+...+n where n is given as user input.

Sample output:

```
Last number? 3
The sum is 6
```

The previous example calculated 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

```
Last number? 7
The sum is 28
```

And this one calculated 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
