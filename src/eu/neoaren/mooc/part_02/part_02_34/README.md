# Part 02 - 34 - Advanced astrology

### Part 1: Printing stars and spaces

Define a method called `printSpaces(int number)` that produces the number of spaces specified by `number`. The method does not print the line break.

You will also have to either copy the `printStars` method your previous answer or reimplement it in this exercise template.

### Part 2: Printing a right-leaning triangle

Create a method called `printTriangle(int size)` that uses `printSpaces` and `printStars` to print the correct triangle. So the method call `printTriangle(4)` should print the following:

```
   *
  **
 ***
****
```

### Part 3: Printing a Christmas tree

Define a method called `christmasTree(int height)` that prints the correct Christmas tree. The Christmas tree consists of a triangle with the specified height as well as the base. The base is two stars high and three stars wide, and is placed at the center of the triangle's bottom. The tree is to be constructed by using the methods `printSpaces` and `printStars`.

For example, the call `christmasTree(4)` should print the following:

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
  ***
  ***
```

The call `christmasTree(10)` should print:

```
         *
        ***
       *****
      *******
     *********
    ***********
   *************

**NB!** Heights shorter than 3 don't have to work correctly!
