# Part 02 - 16 - From where to where?

Write a program which prints the integers from 1 to a number given by the user. Ask the user for the starting point as well.

**Hint** the number read from the user is now the upper limit of the condition. Remember that in Java `a <= b` means *a is smaller or equal to b*.

```
Where to? 8
Where from? 5
5
6
7
8
```

If the upper limit is larger than the starting point, nothing is printed:

```
Where to? 12
Where from? 16
```

**NB!** remember that the lower and upper limits can be negative!
